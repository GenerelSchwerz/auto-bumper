I could not make this any more simple. 


Your default prefix is "!". You can change that in config.json

Authorized Users = anyone who can turn the bots on and off.
Super Users = those who can add other people to the auth user list using the (prefix)adduser command.

Do (prefix)help to get the command list. It's pretty self-explanatory.

Auto mode = everything starts running without any user input. You can still run commands while in auto mode.
(It's just for the really damn lazy people)

Manual mode = you must start the bots manually once. Other than that, you're fine.
You can target one channel per server for as many servers as you'd like. So long as your account is in all of those servers.

Have fun!
